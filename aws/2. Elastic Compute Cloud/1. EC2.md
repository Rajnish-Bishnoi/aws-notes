# EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

## Introduction to Amazon EC2:

1. **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)** is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
2. It allows you to create and manage **virtual servers**, known as **instances**, to run your applications.
3. An **instance** is a virtual server in the cloud that can host your software or services.
4. EC2 was **launched by AWS in 2006**.
5. With EC2, you're essentially **creating Virtual Machines (VMs) in the cloud**.
6. Each **instance type** offers different compute, memory, and storage capacities to suit various workload requirements.
7. EC2 stands for **Elastic Compute Cloud** â€” the term "elastic" means you can scale resources up or down as needed.
8. You can choose any **Operating System** for your instance (Linux, Windows, etc.).
9. You can run various applications on EC2 such as **databases, websites, and more**.
10. EC2 falls under the **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)** category in cloud computing.
11. You can customize compute capacity: **CPU, RAM, storage, and network** configurations.
12. You can **launch as many or as few EC2 instances** as needed.
13. EC2 instances are **region-specific** (not global), so you must select a region.
14. Under the **Free Tier**, you can run an EC2 Linux or Windows instance **for up to 750 hours per month**.

## EC2 Instance Launch Requirements:

To create an EC2 instance, the following components are required:

1. **AMI (Amazon Machine Image):**

   * A template with the OS and software configuration.
   * Example: *Amazon Linux 2023 AMI, Ubuntu 20.04, Windows Server 2022*.

2. **Instance Type:**

   * Defines CPU, RAM, storage, and network power.
   * Example: *t2.micro (Free Tier), t3.medium (general purpose)*.

3. **Security Group:**

   * Acts as a virtual firewall to control traffic.
   * Example: Allow port 22 for SSH, port 80 for HTTP.

4. **Key Pair:**

   * Used to securely connect (SSH) to your Linux instance.
   * Example: *raj-key.pem* used while connecting via terminal.

5. **Storage:**

   * Choose between **EBS (Elastic Block Store)** or **Instance Store**.
   * Example: *8 GB gp2 EBS volume attached at /dev/xvda*.

6. **Network Settings:**

   * Choose **VPC, subnet, and IP addressing**.
   * Example: *Default VPC with public subnet and auto-assigned public IP*.

7. **Tags (Optional):**

   * Helps in organizing and identifying instances.
   * Example: *Name = WebServer-1, Project = AWS-Lab*.

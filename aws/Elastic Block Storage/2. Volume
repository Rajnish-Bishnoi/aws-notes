# 📦 Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) Notes

Amazon **EBS (Elastic Block Store)** provides persistent, block-level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances.

---

## 📁 What is EBS Volume?

- Network-attached virtual hard disk for EC2
- Independent of EC2 instance lifecycle (persistent)
- Exists in a specific **Availability Zone (AZ)**
- Can be attached/detached from EC2
- Can be formatted, mounted, resized
- Can be backed up using **snapshots**
- Cannot be shared across AZs (copy snapshot instead)

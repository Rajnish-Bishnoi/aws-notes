# 🖼️ AMI – Amazon Machine Image

## 📘 What is AMI?

An **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)** is a **pre-configured template** that includes:

- An **Operating System** (Linux, Windows, etc.)
- Optional **pre-installed software**, tools, and configurations

💡 **Think of AMI like a snapshot** that you can use to launch EC2 instances with the same base setup every time.

## 🧑‍💻 Custom AMIs (Most Common in Real World)

In real-world scenarios, we often use **custom AMIs** to save time and maintain consistency across environments.

### 🛠️ How to Create a Custom AMI:

1. **Launch** an EC2 instance using any existing AMI (e.g., Ubuntu or Amazon Linux)
2. **Install & configure** all required tools or software (e.g., Docker, Nginx, code, etc.)
3. Go to **Actions → Create Image** to make your **Custom AMI**
4. Once your custom AMI is created, you can **terminate the original instance**
5. Launch any number of new EC2 instances using your **custom AMI**

> ✅ This helps you save configuration time and ensure all instances behave the same.

## 🔐 AMI Permissions

| Feature              | Details                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔒 Private (Default)  | AMIs are private by default – only accessible to the account owner      |
| 🤝 Share with Others  | You can share AMIs with specific AWS Account IDs                        |
| 🌐 Public AMIs        | Optionally, make an AMI public – usable by all AWS accounts             |
| 🌍 Region Specific     | AMIs are only available within the region they were created in          |

## 🧯 AMI = EC2 Backup 📦

Creating an AMI of an EC2 instance is effectively like **taking a full backup** of:

- The operating system
- Installed packages
- Configured tools
- Application code (if any)

You can **restore or clone** the EC2 instance anytime using this AMI.

## 🧪 Practice Exercises

Follow these tasks to practice working with AMIs:

1. 🟢 **Launch an EC2 instance** using the **Ubuntu AMI** in the **Mumbai region**
2. 🌐 **Install Nginx** and host a simple **static website**
3. 🛠️ **Create a custom AMI** from this configured instance
4. ❌ **Terminate** the original EC2 instance
5. 🔁 **Re-create** the same instance using the **custom AMI**, but this time in the **North Virginia region**

| What is AMI?       | A launch template for EC2 with OS + tools                              |
| Custom AMIs        | Your own templates with pre-configured software                        |
| Permissions        | Private by default, sharable, public option available                  |
| Region Specificity | AMIs are bound to one AWS region                                       |
| Use Case           | Backup, scaling identical servers, disaster recovery                   |

## 💡 Real-World Example

You're a DevOps engineer who configured an EC2 instance with:

- Node.js
- PM2 process manager
- Git & deployment keys

Instead of repeating the setup for every new developer or server:

> 🔁 **Create a custom AMI**, then reuse it to instantly launch new servers with the same configuration.

---

> 🔚 AMIs save you time, reduce human error, and make cloud deployment repeatable and reliable!

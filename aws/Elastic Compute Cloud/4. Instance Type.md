# EC2 Instance Types & Families

Amazon EC2 provides a variety of instance types tailored to meet different workload requirements. Selecting the right instance type is essential to optimize both performance and cost.

---

## 1. General Purpose Instances

* Balanced performance for compute, memory, and networking
* Ideal for **non mission-critical applications**

**Use Cases:**

* Development & Testing Environments
* Web Applications
* Small & Medium Databases
* Virtual Desktops

**Example:** `t3a.medium`, `m5.large`

---

## 2. Compute Optimized Instances

* High ratio of CPU to memory
* Best suited for compute-intensive workloads

**Use Cases:**

* High-performance web servers
* Scientific modeling
* Batch processing

**Example:** `c5a.large`, `c6g.2xlarge`

---

## 3. Memory Optimized Instances

* High memory (RAM) to CPU ratio
* Best for memory-intensive applications

**Use Cases:**

* SAP HANA (in-memory database)
* High-performance cache servers (Redis, Memcached)

**Example:** `r5a.large`, `x1e.xlarge`

---

## 4. Storage Optimized Instances

* High disk throughput and low latency
* Optimized for high IOPS workloads

**Use Cases:**

* NoSQL databases (e.g., Cassandra)
* Data warehousing
* Elasticsearch clusters

**Example:** `d3.xlarge`, `i3.large`

---

## 5. GPU Instances

* Equipped with Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)

**Use Cases:**

* Machine Learning & AI workloads
* Video rendering
* Gaming & simulations

**Example:** `p4d.24xlarge`, `g5.2xlarge`

---

## AMD Processors in AWS

* **"a"** in the instance name denotes AMD processors
* Lower cost with competitive performance

**Example:** `c5a.2xlarge`

* `c` = Compute optimized
* `5` = 5th generation
* `a` = AMD Processor
* `2xlarge` = Instance size

---

## Burstable Instances (T Family)

* Instance types: `t2`, `t3`, `t3a`, etc.
* Accumulate **CPU credits** when idle
* Can burst CPU performance when needed
* Returns to **baseline performance** when credits are used up

**Example:** `t3a.medium` (1 vCPU + 2GB RAM)

## Example FAQ Answer:

> **Which instance type are you using in your project?**
>
> * `c5a.large` - Compute optimized (AMD)

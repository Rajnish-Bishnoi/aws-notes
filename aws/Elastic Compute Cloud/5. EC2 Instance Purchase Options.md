# EC2 Instance Purchase Options (AWS Cost Optimization)

> 📘 [Official AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-purchasing-options.html)

When launching EC2 instances, AWS offers different pricing models to suit various needs and budgets. Choosing the right one can help reduce your AWS bill significantly.

---

## 🟢 1. On-Demand Instances

These are **pay-as-you-go** instances. You launch them whenever you need and stop them when you're done. Most flexible but **more expensive** compared to other options.

### 💡 Best For:
- Short-term, unpredictable workloads
- Testing, POCs (Proof of Concepts)
- Startups or small projects
- Example: Flipkart needs 20 extra servers for its “Big Billion Day” sale.

### 💵 Billing:
- Charged **only when instance is running**
- **Fixed hourly rate**
- No long-term commitment

### ✅ Key Points:
- Pay per hour or second (based on instance type)
- No upfront payment
- No predictable usage required

---

## 🟠 2. Reserved Instances (RI)

Reserved Instances provide **significant discounts** (up to 75%) compared to On-Demand pricing, but require a **1-year or 3-year** commitment.

### 💡 Best For:
- Long-term workloads (min 1 year)
- Predictable usage (e.g., internal applications)

### 🧾 Billing Options:
- **Standard RI** – Up to 75% discount, fixed instance type
- **Convertible RI** – Can change instance type, OS, tenancy
- **Scheduled RI** – Reserved for specific time periods (e.g., 5 hours every Friday)

### 🛒 Other Details:
- You can **sell** unused RIs in the AWS Marketplace
- Once purchased, AWS **does not refund** RIs

### 🔐 Payment Plans:
- All Upfront
- Partial Upfront
- No Upfront

---

## 🟣 3. Dedicated Hosts

AWS assigns an **entire physical server** (host) to you. Use this when you want **license compliance** (e.g., bring your own Windows or Oracle license).

### 💡 Best For:
- Enterprises with **software license restrictions**
- Security or compliance-focused workloads

### ✅ Key Benefits:
- Visibility into sockets/cores/host-level metrics
- Control instance placement
- Bring Your Own License (BYOL)

---

## 🔵 4. Spot Instances

These are the **cheapest** option (up to 90% discount) as AWS allocates **unused capacity** to you. However, they can be **terminated anytime** with 2 minutes’ notice if AWS needs the capacity back.

### 💡 Best For:
- Fault-tolerant, stateless, or flexible workloads
- Big data processing
- CI/CD, testing, and containerized workloads (e.g., Kubernetes)

### 📉 Key Points:
- Prices fluctuate based on **demand and supply**
- Purchased through **bidding or spot requests**
- High cost savings, but less reliable

### ⚠️ Spot Interruption:
- AWS gives **2 minutes warning** before reclaiming the instance

| Purchase Option   | Cost         | Commitment       | Use Case Example                     |
|------------------|--------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| On-Demand        | High         | None             | Short POC or sudden traffic spike    |
| Reserved         | Low (75% off)| 1 or 3 years     | Stable, long-term application        |
| Dedicated Host   | Very High    | Long-term        | License-sensitive enterprise usage   |
| Spot Instances   | Very Low     | No commitment    | Batch jobs, non-critical workloads   |

### 📌 Final Tip:
Choose the **right mix** of instance types depending on workload type, budget, and duration. Use **AWS Cost Explorer** and **Savings Plans** to optimize your costs further.

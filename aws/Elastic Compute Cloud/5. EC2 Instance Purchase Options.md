📆 EC2 Instance Purchase Options (Cost Optimization)

Official AWS Docs

🟢 1. On-Demand Instances

These are flexible EC2 instances that you can launch and terminate anytime, paying only for the time used.

Best for:

POC (Proof of Concept) work

Short-term or unpredictable workloads

Temporary spikes in traffic (e.g., during festive sales)

Billing:

Pay per Hour/Second (based on instance type)

No long-term commitment

Charged only while running

🧠 Example: You’re testing a new feature over 2 days. Use On-Demand to avoid fixed contracts.

🟠 2. Reserved Instances (RI)

Reserved Instances allow you to reserve capacity for 1 or 3 years, offering up to 75% discount over On-Demand pricing.

Best for:

Predictable, long-term workloads

Production systems running 24x7

Types of RIs:

Standard RI — Fixed size, OS

Convertible RI — Can change OS, instance family

Scheduled RI — Reserved for specific hours

Billing:

All upfront / Partial upfront / No upfront

Locked-in, but can be sold on AWS RI Marketplace

🧠 Example: Backend service expected to run non-stop for 3 years should use RI for cost efficiency.

🔸 3. Dedicated Hosts

A physical server dedicated to your account.

Best for:

Compliance needs

Software requiring BYOL (Bring Your Own License)

Use Cases:

Track software licenses

Meet corporate/government security policies

🧠 Example: A healthcare company using legacy software licenses for Windows servers.

🔹 4. Spot Instances

These are unused EC2 capacities offered at up to 90% discount.

Best for:

Fault-tolerant and stateless applications

Big data jobs, CI/CD pipelines, testing environments

Risks:

Can be interrupted with 2 minutes notice

Not suitable for critical production workloads

Buying Options:

Based on your bid and market price

🧠 Example: Data processing jobs that can restart without issues if interrupted.

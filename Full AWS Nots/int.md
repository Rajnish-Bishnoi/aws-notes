### üß† 10 Real-World Scenario-Based Interview Questions

1. **Q: EC2 can‚Äôt connect to internet, what could be the cause?**

   * Check route table, subnet (public/private), internet/NAT gateway, and security group.

2. **Q: S3 access denied ‚Äì why?**

   * Might be due to IAM policy, S3 bucket policy, or lack of ACL permissions.

3. **Q: Application hosted on EC2 is slow ‚Äì how to debug?**

   * Use CloudWatch metrics, check CPU usage, add Auto Scaling, or optimize instance type.

4. **Q: Lambda giving timeout error?**

   * Increase timeout in config, check dependencies or network timeouts.

5. **Q: How to secure EC2?**

   * Use security groups, limit SSH via IP, use IAM roles not access keys.

6. **Q: RDS is not connecting from EC2. Why?**

   * Ensure RDS is in same VPC, SG allows inbound, subnet is public/private accordingly.

7. **Q: My app needs fast access to session data. What to use?**

   * Amazon ElastiCache (Redis/Memcached)

8. **Q: Lambda needs DB access but has no credentials. Solution?**

   * Assign IAM Role to Lambda with necessary DB access policies.

9. **Q: How to audit all changes done in AWS account?**

   * Use AWS CloudTrail.

10. **Q: How to recover data if S3 object is deleted accidentally?**

* Enable S3 versioning and lifecycle policies.
